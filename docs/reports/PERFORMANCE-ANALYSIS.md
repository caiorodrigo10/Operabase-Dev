# Performance Analysis Report

## Current System Analysis

### Identified Performance Issues

#### 1. Frontend Query Management
- Multiple unoptimized queries running simultaneously
- Lack of query stale time configuration
- Missing query optimization strategies
- Excessive re-renders due to dependency arrays

#### 2. Calendar Component Bottlenecks
- Heavy computation in render cycles
- Collision detection running on every render
- No memoization of expensive calculations
- Redundant filtering operations

#### 3. Backend Query Inefficiencies
- Missing database indexes
- N+1 query patterns
- Unoptimized JOIN operations
- Lack of query result caching

#### 4. Network Performance
- Multiple sequential API calls
- No request batching
- Missing response compression
- Lack of proper caching headers

## Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: Frontend Optimizations
1. Implement React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
2. Optimize useQuery configurations with stale time and cache time
3. Implement proper debouncing for user inputs
4. Add lazy loading for calendar components

### Phase 2: Backend Optimizations
1. Add database indexes for frequently queried columns
2. Optimize SQL queries and eliminate N+1 patterns
3. Implement response caching
4. Add query batching endpoints

### Phase 3: Calendar-Specific Optimizations
1. Memoize collision detection calculations
2. Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
3. Optimize appointment filtering logic
4. Cache Google Calendar API responses

### Phase 4: System-Wide Improvements
1. Implement service worker for caching
2. Add gzip compression
3. Optimize bundle size
4. Implement progressive loading
